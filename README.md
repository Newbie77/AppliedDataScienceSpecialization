# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization
A specialization that consists of 5 courses provided by University of Michigan on Coursera. The specialization introduces learners to data science through the Python programming language. 

## Target Audiance
This **skills-based** specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to **apply** statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

> Level: Intermediate

## Courses of Specialization
* Course 1: Introduction to Data Science in Python
* Course 2: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
* Course 3: Applied Machine Learning in Python
* Course 4: Applied Text Mining in Python
* Course 5: Applied Social Network Analysis in Python


## Repo Contents
* Lectures of the instructor 
* Files added by the instructor (csv, xls, etc..)
* Codes and notebooks added by the instructor
* My own codes while applying skills (format: 'AsmaaXXXX.py')
* My brief notes during the courses (Very poor since courses are code-based)

> Most of notes in notes document are copied from the lectures, my own notes are added as comment lines between /\* \*/ so they may contain incorrect info
